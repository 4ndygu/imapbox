Dump imap inbox to a local folder in a regular backupable format: html, json and attachements.

This program aims to save a mailbox for archive using files in indexable or searchable formats.
The produced files should be readables without external software, for example, to find an email in backups using only the terminal

For each email in the imap mailbox, create a folder with the following content:

* __message.html__ if an html part exists for the message body. the message.html will allways be in utf-8, the embeded images links are modified to refer to the attachments subfolder
* __attachements__ The attachements folder contains the attached files and the embeded images
* __message.txt__ this file contain the body text if available in the original email, allways converted in utf-8
* __metadata.json__ Various informations in JSON format, date, recipients, body text, etc... This file can be used from external applications or a search engine like [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.com/)
* __raw.eml.gz__ A gziped version of the email in eml format

Imapbox was designed to archive multiple mailboxes in one common directory tree,
copies of the same message spread knew several account will be archived once using the Message-Id property.

## Install

You need python 2 to run this script, and the [chardet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet) library.

## Use cases

* I use the script to merge all my mail accounts in one searchable directory on my NAS server.
* Report on a website the content of an email address, like a mailing list.
* Sharing address of several employees to perform cross-searches on a common database.
* Archiving an imap account because of mailbox size restrictions, or to restrain the used disk space on the imap server

## Elasticsearch

The metadata.json file contain the necessary informations for a search engine like [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.com/).
Populate an elasticsearch index with the emails metadata can be done with a simple script

Create an index:
```bash
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/imapbox?pretty'
```

Add all emails to index:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd emails/
for ID in */ ; do
    curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/imapbox/message/${ID}?pretty" --data-binary "@${ID}/metadata.json"
done
```

A front-end can be used to search in email archives:

* [Calaca](https://github.com/polo2ro/Calaca) is a beautiful, easy to use, search UI for Elasticsearch.
* [Facetview](https://github.com/okfn/facetview)


## Search in emails without indexation process

[jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

Example command to browse emails:

```bash
find . -name "*.json" | xargs cat | jq '[.Date, .Id, .Subject, " âœ‰ "] + .From | join(" ")'
```

Example with a filter on UTC date:

```bash
find . -name "*.json" | xargs cat | jq 'select(.Utc > "20150221T130000Z")'
```
